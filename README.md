# ADT-Project-ENEE-150
ADT Hash Table Project for ENEE-150

The purpose of this project is to build a hash table abstract data type. The ADT will permit users
to insert and search for data records in the hash table; it will also allow users to resize
the hash table on-the-fly to improve data search time. 

The ADT will be polymorphic, permitting the data record type to be defined by the user, and
permitting the user to control printing of data elements via a user-provided function accessed
by the ADT through a function pointer. In addition to building the hash table ADT, the programmer has also rewritten a program 
from the ENEE-150 course to be compatible with the ADT. In addition, the ADT has been run
with a program that tests the resizing feature and shows its effect on search performance.
